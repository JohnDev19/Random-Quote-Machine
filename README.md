6. On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with `id="text"`.
7. On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with `id="author"`.
8. When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.
9. My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the `#new-quote` button is clicked and display it in the `#author` element.
10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the `#tweet-quote` `a` element. This `a` element should include the `"twitter.com/intent/tweet"` path in its `href` attribute to tweet the current quote.
